# TargetTracket
Target Tracker is a simple android project aimed at providing better planning and tracking to students.
Students can plan their day accordingly and in turn this app keeps a track of all the activities a user has to do and reminds them prior to the elapsed time.
Apart from this this application also keeps a track of all the previous records of the user, providing user details about the task they completed or were unable to do so.
Also,for more motivation it provides a graph for better visualization so that user can see how much they are on the right track.
I started created this application solely for learning purpose and hope that all the users will also find it motivating in their cases.

Any one interested in making this project even better is whole heartedly welcome.!!
